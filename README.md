# orbitalMenu.js

A basic radial menu that (sorta) mimics Path's navigation UI. Please __do not use as is__ to avoid similarities with the original. Style the CSS a bit.

## Technical details

It utilizes css3 transforms and transitions to facilitate the animation. It is currently not tested in IE8- so be wary of using it for actual production.

## Example Code

```
 var orbitalMenu = new RadialMenu();
```

## Methods

show the menu
```
orbitalMenu.show();
```

hide the menu
```
orbitalMenu.hide();
```
